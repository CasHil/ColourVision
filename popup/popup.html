                    Our goal at ColourVision is to make the web more accessible for
                    colourblind people in a transparent way.

                    Before completing the installation of this plugin, you were asked if
                    you were okay with the plugin being able to <b>read and change all your
                    data on all sites</b>. The plugin needs this access to be able to <b>change
                    the colours</b> on the web page and <b>nothing else</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many browser plugins are not <b>open-source</b>, meaning you have to trust 
                    that it only does what it tells you it is doing. We believe that <b>transparency is 
                    important</b> when dealing with information that is as <b>sensitive</b> as your 
                    browsing behaviour. Therefore, anyone may inspect the code by clicking the image 
                    in the top right and suggest changes. You can also <b>see what data the plugin
                    is collecting</b> by clicking the link in the bottom right.
