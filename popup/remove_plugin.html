        <p>You have not used this extension in over a month. Having unnecessary extensions contributes 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_data">dark data</a>, 
            data that is unused. It is 
            <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/poms.12832">estimated</a> 
            that 99.5% of all data is dark data. This much dark data requires a lot of storage space on servers and computers all over the world, which costs a lot of electricity.
            Some advantages to deleting unnecessary extensions (including this one):
        </p> 
        <ol>
            <li>Avoiding dark data can help you <b>protect your personal privacy and security</b>. By not letting extensions collect and store large amounts of data that may be sensitive or personally identifiable, you can reduce your risk of having your information accessed or misused by others. </li>
            <li>It <b>saves processing power</b>. Indivdually, this plugin may not use much. However, the more plugins, tabs and programs you have open, the more processing power is used. By closing and uninstalling extensions you don't use, you save on computing power and electricity costs.</li>
            <li>It helps <b>reduce digital clutter</b>, which can help you simplify your daily activities on your computer.</li>
